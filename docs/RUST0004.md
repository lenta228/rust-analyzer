# RUST0004: Deprecated Hook Usage

## Problem

A hook method is using a deprecated hook signature that has been replaced with a newer version.

## Description

Oxide and Rust plugins evolve over time, and some hook methods become obsolete or are replaced with more accurate or efficient alternatives. This analyzer helps developers identify and update deprecated hooks to maintain compatibility with the latest plugin system.

## Examples

### Incorrect Implementation ❌

```csharp
// Deprecated hook
void OnPlayerInit(BasePlayer player)
{
    // This hook is no longer recommended
}
```

### Correct Implementation ✅

```csharp
// Use the recommended replacement hook
void OnPlayerConnected(BasePlayer player)
{
    // Updated hook implementation
}
```

## Why This Matters

1. Using deprecated hooks can lead to unexpected behavior
2. Deprecated hooks may be removed in future versions
3. Newer hooks often provide more accurate or comprehensive information

## How to Fix

1. Replace the deprecated hook with its recommended replacement
2. Update method signature to match the new hook
3. Migrate any existing logic to the new hook method

## Configuration

This rule is enabled by default and will trigger a warning when:
- A method name matches a known deprecated hook
- The method signature exactly matches the deprecated hook

## Suppressing Warnings

In rare cases, you may need to suppress this warning:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable RUST0004
void OnPlayerInit(BasePlayer player) // Suppressed warning
{
    // Legacy code that must remain
}
#pragma warning restore RUST0004
```
